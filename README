This Firefox and Thunderbird extension provides a minimal remote
control facility, which includes a JavaScript REPL.  Instead of
listening for a telnet connection like mozrepl, icerepl binds to an
AF_UNIX socket in each Mozilla profile directory and accepts commands
from the icerepl Python client.  Configuration is automatic and
secure.

Icerepl has commands for evaluating JavaScript expressions, changing
preferences, and starting a readline-enabled interactive shell.
